    "[Expert] Exercise: Describe how @property and @lazy property are being used to build a pipeline for Tensorflow Models in this blog post: https://danijar.com/structuring-your-tensorflow-models/\n",
    "\n",
    "** Answer: @property, @lazy_property is a decorator designed for methods of class objects. @property allows the user to access to methods of the class as if they are attributes. @property protects users of the class if the designer of the class changes the attribute to a method. Specifically, in the blog post, you can access `prediction`, `optimize`, and `error` as attributes even though they are methods. This is important because Tensorflow expresses computation as a computational graph. The first version of the model definition loads everything up at the same time in the `__init__` method. This is often unncessary. You don't need to add specific functions or operations to the computational graph until you need them. Hence, having methods for `prediction`, `optimize`, and `error` is useful but at the same time you want the ability to access these methods as attributes. @lazy_property is a slightly customized deocrator which allows for similar functionality as @property but the methods are mostly Tensorflow code instead of containing other housekeeping code which makes the code much easier to read. **"
