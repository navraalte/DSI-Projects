    "Another way of looking at it...<a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning/lecture/XKsl6/random-forests> Coursera RF </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "While DTs are powerful, DTs have some limitations. In particular, trees that are **grown very deep** tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they **overfit their training sets.** Bagging helps mitigate this problem by exposing different trees to different sub-samples of the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are a further way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are some of the most widespread classifiers and regression models used.  They are relatively simple to use because they require very few parameters to set and they perform pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Check:** Describe how the bagging algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Random forests_ differ from bagging decision tree in only one way: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a **random subset of the features**. This process is sometimes called \"feature bagging\". The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the bagging base trees, causing them to become correlated. By selecting a random subset of the features at each split, we counter this correlation between base trees, strengthening the overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, for a classification problem with $p$ features, $\\sqrt{p}$ (rounded down) features are used in each split. For regression problems the inventors recommend $p/3$ (rounded down) with a minimum node size of 5 as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extremely Randomized Trees\n",
    "Adding one further step of randomization yields extremely randomized trees, or _ExtraTrees_. These are trained using bagging and the random subspace method, like in an ordinary random forest, but an additional layer of randomness is introduced. Instead of computing the locally optimal feature/split combination (based on, e.g., information gain or the Gini impurity), **for each feature under consideration, a random value is selected for the split.** This value is selected from the feature's empirical range (in the tree's training set, i.e., the bootstrap sample), in other words, the top-down splitting in the tree learner is randomized.\n"

    "_Boosting_ is a different ensembling technique that is sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative procedure that adaptively changes the sampling distribution of training records at each iteration, in order to correct the errors of the previous iteration of models. The first iteration uses uniform weights (like bagging) for all samples. In subsequent iterations, the weights are adjusted to emphasize records that were misclassified in previous iterations. The final prediction is constructed by a weighted vote (where the weights for a base classifier depends on its training error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base classifier's focus more and more closely on records that are difficult to classify as the sequence of iterations progresses, they are faced with progressively more difficult learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting takes a base _weak_ learner and tries to make it a _strong_ learner by re-training it on the misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
