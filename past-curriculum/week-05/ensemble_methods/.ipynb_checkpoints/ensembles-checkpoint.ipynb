    "## Review: Random Forest (25 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are some of the most widespread classifiers used.  They are relatively simple to use because they require very few parameters to set and they perform pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://citizennet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/RF.jpg> \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have see, Decision Trees are very powerful machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** What are the main advantages of decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand Decision Trees have some limitations, in particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they overfit their training sets. Bagging helps mitigate this problem by exposing different trees to different sub-samples of the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are a further way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Describe how the bagging algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Random forests_ differ from bagging decision tree in only one way: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a **random subset of the features**. This process is sometimes called \"feature bagging\". The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the bagging base trees, causing them to become correlated. By selecting a random subset of the features at each split, we counter this correlation between base trees, strengthening the overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** recall what are the two properties base models must satisfy in order for bagging to work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, for a classification problem with $p$ features, $\\sqrt{p}$ (rounded down) features are used in each split. For regression problems the inventors recommend $p/3$ (rounded down) with a minimum node size of 5 as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extremely Randomized Trees\n",
    "Adding one further step of randomization yields extremely randomized trees, or _ExtraTrees_. These are trained using bagging and the random subspace method, like in an ordinary random forest, but an additional layer of randomness is introduced. Instead of computing the locally optimal feature/split combination (based on, e.g., information gain or the Gini impurity), for each feature under consideration, a random value is selected for the split. This value is selected from the feature's empirical range (in the tree's training set, i.e., the bootstrap sample), in other words, the top-down splitting in the tree learner is randomized."

    "Gradient Boosting is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. GBRT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems. Gradient Tree Boosting models are used in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.\n",

On the other hand Ensemble methods perform better in more complex scenarios, but may become very complicated and harder to explain.\n",
