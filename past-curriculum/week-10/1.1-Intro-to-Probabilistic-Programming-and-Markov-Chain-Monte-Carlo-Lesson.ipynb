Where as **frequentist just assume that the hypothesis is true** and ask the question, what is the likelihood of seeing the data given the that hypothesis is true -- they only use the likelihood probability. \n",

    "### Probability Distribuitons \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's quickly recall what a probability distribution is:** Let $Z$ be some random variable. Then associated with $Z$ is a *probability distribution function* that assigns probabilities to the different outcomes $Z$ can take. Graphically, a probability distribution is a curve where the probability of an outcome is proportional to the height of the curve. You can see examples in the first figure of this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide random variables into three classifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **$Z$ is discrete**: Discrete random variables may only assume values on a specified list. Things like populations, movie ratings, and number of votes are all discrete random variables. Discrete random variables become more clear when we contrast them with...\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **$Z$ is continuous**: Continuous random variable can take on arbitrarily exact values. For example, temperature, speed, time, color are all modeled as continuous variables because you can progressively make the values more and more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$Z$ is mixed**: Mixed random variables assign probabilities to both discrete and continuous random variables, i.e. it is a combination of the above two categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Case\n",
    "If $Z$ is discrete, then its distribution is called a *probability mass function*, which measures the probability $Z$ takes on the value $k$, denoted $P(Z=k)$. Note that the probability mass function completely describes the random variable $Z$, that is, if we know the mass function, we know how $Z$ should behave. There are popular probability mass functions that consistently appear: we will introduce them as needed, but let's introduce the first very useful probability mass function. We say $Z$ is *Poisson*-distributed if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Z = k) =\\frac{ \\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda} }{k!}, \\; \\; k=0,1,2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda$ is called a parameter of the distribution, and it controls the distribution's shape. For the Poisson distribution, $\\lambda$ can be any positive number. By increasing $\\lambda$, we add more probability to larger values, and conversely by decreasing $\\lambda$ we add more probability to smaller values. One can describe $\\lambda$ as the *intensity* of the Poisson distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike $\\lambda$, which can be any positive number, the value $k$ in the above formula must be a non-negative integer, i.e., $k$ must take on values 0,1,2, and so on. This is very important, because if you wanted to model a population you could not make sense of populations with 4.25 or 5.612 members. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a random variable $Z$ has a Poisson mass distribution, we denote this by writing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful property of the Poisson distribution is that its expected value is equal to its parameter, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\large[ \\;Z\\; | \\; \\lambda \\;\\large] = \\lambda $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this property often, so it's useful to remember. Below, we plot the probability mass distribution for different $\\lambda$ values. The first thing to notice is that by increasing $\\lambda$, we add more probability of larger values occurring. Second, notice that although the graph ends at 15, the distributions do not. They assign positive probability to every non-negative integer."

    "\n",
    "We will model the problem above using PyMC3. This type of programming is called **probabilistic programming**, an unfortunate misnomer that invokes ideas of randomly-generated code and has likely confused and frightened users away from this field. The code is not random; it is probabilistic in the sense that we create probability models using programming variables as the model's components. Model components are first-class primitives within the PyMC3 framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the confusion engendered by the term *probabilistic programming*, I'll refrain from using it. Instead, I'll simply say *programming*, since that's what it really is. \n",

    ">The notation in `theano` is remarkably similar to NumPy. It also supports many of the familiar computational elements of NumPy. However, while NumPy directly executes computations, e.g. when you run `a + b`, `theano` instead builds up a **\"computation graph\"** that tracks that you want to perform the `+` operation on the elements `a` and `b`. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Only when you `eval()` a `theano` expression does the computation take place (i.e. `theano` is lazy evaluated -- similar to Spark). Once the compute graph is built, we can perform all kinds of mathematical optimizations (e.g. simplifications):\n",

    "    Compile the entire graph to C to run at machine speed\n",
    "    Compile it to run on the GPU. \n",

    ">PyMC3 is basically a collection of `theano` symbolic expressions for various probability distributions that are combined to one big compute graph making up the whole model log probability, and a collection of inference algorithms that use that graph to compute probabilities and gradients. \n",

    "For practical purposes, what this means is that in order to build certain models we sometimes have to use `theano`.\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Bayesian methodology returns a *distribution*. Hence we now have distributions to describe the unknown $\\lambda$s and $\\tau$. What have we gained? Immediately, we can see the uncertainty in our estimates: the wider the distribution, the less certain our posterior belief should be. We can also see what the plausible values for the parameters are: $\\lambda_1$ is around 18 and $\\lambda_2$ is around 23. The posterior distributions of the two $\\lambda$s are clearly distinct, indicating that it is indeed likely that there was a change in the user's text-message behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "What other observations can you make? If you look at the original data again, do these results seem reasonable? \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that the posterior distributions for the $\\lambda$s do not look like exponential distributions, even though our priors for these variables were exponential. In fact, the posterior distributions are not really of any form that we recognize from the original model. But that's OK! This is one of the benefits of taking a computational point of view. If we had instead done this analysis using mathematical approaches, we would have been stuck with an analytically intractable (and messy) distribution. Our use of a computational approach makes us indifferent to mathematical tractability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis also returned a distribution for $\\tau$. Its posterior distribution looks a little different from the other two because it is a discrete random variable, so it doesn't assign probabilities to intervals. We can see that near day 45, there was a 50% chance that the user's behaviour changed. Had no change occurred, or had the change been gradual over time, the posterior distribution of $\\tau$ would have been more spread out, reflecting that many days were plausible candidates for $\\tau$. By contrast, in the actual results we see that only three or four days make any sense as potential transition points. "

    "\n",
    "This transition kernel implies that movement is not guaranteed at every step. It only occurs if the suggested transition is likely based on the acceptance ratio.\n",

    "A single iteration of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",

    "The choice of the random walk distribution for $\\epsilon_t$ is frequently a normal or Student’s $t$ density, but it may be any distribution that generates an irreducible proposal chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration is the specification of the **scale parameter** for the random walk error distribution. Large values produce random walk steps that are highly exploratory, but tend to produce proposal values in the tails of the target distribution, potentially resulting in very small acceptance rates. Conversely, small values tend to be accepted more frequently, since they tend to produce proposals close to the current parameter value, but may result in chains that ***mix*** very slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some simulation studies suggest optimal acceptance rates in the range of 20-50%. It is often worthwhile to optimize the proposal variance by iteratively adjusting its value, according to observed acceptance rates early in the MCMC simulation .\n",
