    "In this lab you will create a content based recommender for New York Times articles. This recommender is an example of a very simple data product. You will follow the same proceedure outlined in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/data-lab/how-we-used-data-to-suggest-tags-for-your-story-a120076d0bb6#.4vu7uby9z) in order to build your very own content based recommender. ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1d/cd/4e/1dcd4e0152a3692314f65a1aafb53982.jpg) However, we will not be recommending tags. Instead we'll be recommending new articles that a user should read based on the article that they are currently reading."

       "u'TOKYO \\u2014  State-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC.UL] will lend about 4 billion yen ($39 million) to Russia\\'s Sberbank, which is subject to Western sanctions, in the hope of advancing talks on a territorial dispute, the Nikkei business daily said on Saturday.\\nSberbank, Russia\\'s biggest bank, will use the yen-denominated loan to help a company operating the port of Vostochny in the Russian Far East to buy coal-handling equipment.\\nJBIC will issue the loan by the end of the year in a bid to encourage progress on a dispute over a string of Russia-controlled Pacific islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and Southern Kuriles in Russia, at a December summit.\\n\"JBIC\\'s move to provide financing to Russia comes because  the Japanese government aims to make progress in the negotiations,\" the Nikkei said.\\nJBIC was not available for comment.\\nJapanese foreign ministry and the prime minister\\'s office were not available for comment.\\nThe United States and the European Union have effectively banned lending to certain Russian companies and financial institutions, including Sberbank, under sanctions imposed after Russia\\'s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\\'s Crimea region.\\nJapanese officials have previously said any economic cooperation with Russia would not run afoul of sanctions.\\nJapan also bars underwriting of bonds issued by Sberbank and other institutions. Though yen-denominated loans are not covered by the sanctions, Japanese banks are leery of lending in Russia amid concern over the U.S. reaction, the Nikkei said.\\nThe loan is part of an eight-point economic cooperation plan presented to Russian President Vladimir Putin by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in May as part of a \"new approach\" to the decade-long dispute.\\nJBIC has started offering ruble-denominated financing this month. To shore up the lender\\'s capital, the Ministry of Finance earmarked 109 billion yen in investment in JBIC in the recently approved second supplementary budget for fiscal 2016, the Nikkei said.\\nAbe is betting that close ties to Putin, as well as Russia\\'s economic woes and regional concerns about China\\'s rise will help him make progress in a decades-old territorial row when they meet in December.\\nThe dispute over the four islands north of Japan\\'s Hokkaido has prevented Tokyo and Moscow signing a peace treaty formally ending the war they fought with each other in World War Two.\\n(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Robert Birsel)'"

If soldiers refuse, they could face interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens, the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/2ew9yQK ) said.\\nFaced with a shortage of troops at the height of the two wars, California Guard officials offered bonuses of $15,000 or more for soldiers to reenlist.\\nA federal investigation in 2010 found thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were improperly doled out to California Guard soldiers. About 9,700 current and retired soldiers received notices to repay some or all of their bonuses with more than $22 million recovered so far.\\nSoldiers said they feel betrayed at having to repay the money.\\n\"These bonuses were used to keep people in,\" said Christopher Van Meter, a 42-year-old former Army captain and Iraq veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart. \"People like me just got screwed.\"\\nVan Meter said he refinanced his home mortgage to repay $25,000 in reenlistment bonuses and $21,000 in student loan repayments that the military says was improperly given to him.\\nThe California Guard said it has to follow the law and collect the money.\\n\"At the end of the day, the soldiers ended up paying the largest price,\" Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, deputy commander of the California Guard told the Times. \"We\\'d be more than happy to absolve these people of their debts. We just can\\'t do it. We\\'d be breaking the law.\"\\nThe Pentagon agency that oversees state Guard groups has said that bonus overpayments occurred in every state, but more so in California, which has 17,000 soldiers.\\nCalifornia Guard officials said they are helping soldiers and veterans file appeals with agencies that can erase the debts. But soldiers said it\\'s a long process and there\\'s no guarantee they\\'ll win.\\nRetired Army major and Iraq veteran Robert D\\'Andrea said he was told to repay his $20,000 because auditors could not find a copy of the contract he says he signed.\\nD\\'Andrea appealed and is running out of options.\\n\"Everything takes months of work, and there is no way to get your day in court,\" he said. \"Some benefit of the doubt has to be given to the soldier.\"'],\n",

They demanded he relieve the burden on Guard members following news reports that soldiers were asked to repay bonuses that in some cases totaled more than $25,000.\\nThe announcement does not end the reimbursement process, but postpones collection efforts while the Pentagon and Congress look for a long-term solution.\\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama was pleased with the decision, but said it was important for the Pentagon \"to follow through\" by finding a long-term solution. Obama had warned the Defense Department earlier this week not to \"nickel and dime\" service members who were victims of wrongdoing by overzealous recruiters.\\nIn a statement issued during a meeting of defense ministers in Brussels, Carter said efforts to collect reimbursement from Guard members should stop \"as soon as is practical.\" Carter said he has ordered the department to set up a streamlined process by Jan. 1 to help troops get relief from the repayment obligation, because the current program has moved too slowly.\\nActing Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine told reporters Wednesday that the process of identifying and processing the California Guard members who might have to repay the money may take up to 10 days.\\n\"If we determine that recoupment was unjustified, there will be a process that allows the recovery of that and the reversal of that money,\" Levine said.\\nLevine said they are looking to set up \"a one-stop place\" for those affected to get a hearing and review, noting that the goal is to eliminate \"a bunch of sequential processes.\" The details of that process have yet to be determined, he said.\\nAmong about 14,000 California Guard members whose bonuses and other incentive payments were reviewed, about 3,000 of those are men and women have since left the National Guard, Levine said. They will be eligible for repayment as well, but it hasn\\'t been determined how those cases will be handled since they do not have current addresses or contact details for many of those individuals, he added.\\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said the move by the Defense Department is \"a long-overdue first step,\" and he vowed to work with Senate colleagues \"to explore all options available to hold those responsible for this unacceptable situation accountable and to ensure this never happens again.\"\\nRep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans\\' Affairs, called the measure \"a weak and ham-handed attempt to shift the focus away from the Obama administration\\'s shameful treatment of service members and veterans.\"\\n\"Carter seems to have no plan to make those who\\'ve already been forced to pay back their bonuses whole, and by focusing only on the California Guard, he is ignoring what media reports indicate could be a national problem,\" Miller said.\\nThe Los Angeles Times reported over the weekend that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of soldiers repay their enlistment bonuses after audits revealed overpayments by the California National Guard. Recruiters under pressure to fill ranks and hit enlistment goals at the height of the two wars improperly offered bonuses of $15,000 or more to soldiers who re-enlisted.\\nIf soldiers refuse to pay the bonus back, they could face interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens.\\n\"While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,\" Carter said, adding that the new process will put \"as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own. At the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer.\"\\nBut the country\\'s largest combat veteran\\'s organization, said the measure \"doesn\\'t go deep enough.\" Brian Duffy, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Auxiliary, said the erroneous bonuses were \"the fault of a system, not of any recipient.\"\\nAs many as 6,500 California National Guard soldiers have been asked to repay the enlistment bonuses.\\n\"We deal with these problems all the time, but we deal with it in ones and twos, not in hundreds and thousands,\" said Gordon Trowbridge, deputy Pentagon press secretary. The Pentagon said it is investigating cases beyond California, but said those will likely add up to \"dozens.\"\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had pressed the Pentagon to suspend the program, said Wednesday, \"I\\'m glad the Pentagon came to its senses.\"\\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also welcomed the development, saying he spoke with Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work Tuesday night and vowed to work with other members of Congress to provide a legislative solution so the repayment issue does not recur.\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., welcomed the Pentagon announcement, but said lawmakers need to find a permanent solution.\\n\"The heroes who served our country in uniform deserve every bonus and benefit they received in good faith,\" she said. \"We all must work together to swiftly address this situation and monitor any additional issues that come up in California and other states.\"\\n___\\nBaldor reported from Brussels.
