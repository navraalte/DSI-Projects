If we have too few recorded events, we get one value for the probability of an event. As we record more and more events, we see that the value for the probability of an event fluxuates, but tends to converge to a single number. For this reason, we tend to approach the true probability as the number of samples **n** approaches infinity (i.e. taking more samples leads to more reliable results).\n",
