    "### Frequentist Probability Summery\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the male height and coin flip examples, that the frequentist probability of an event happening is strongly dependent on the number of events that are recorded. If we have too few recorded events, we get one value for the probability of an event. As we record more and more events, we see that the value for the probability of an event fluxuates, but tends to converge to a single number. For this reason, we tend to approach the true probability as the number of samples **n** approaches infinity (i.e. taking more samples leads to more reliable results).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying Frequentist probability, we need to collected enough samples to be confident in our resulting probability. How we go about quantifying what \"enough samples\" is requires that we speak about [Type 1 and Type 2 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) . A topic that we will cover in the hypothesis testing lesson."
