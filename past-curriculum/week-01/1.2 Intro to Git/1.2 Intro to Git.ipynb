    "- A program you run from the command line\n",
    "- A distributed version control system\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use Git so that they can keep the history of all the changes to their code. This means that they can rollback changes (or switch to older versions) as far back in time as they started using Git on their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A codebase in Git is referred to as a **repository**, or **repo**, for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the principal developer of Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Github](https://github.com/) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hosting service for Git repositories\n",
    "- A web interface to explore Git repositories\n",
    "- A social network of programmers\n",
    "- We all have individual accounts and put our codebases on our Github account\n",
    "- You can follow users and star your favorite projects\n",

We each want to create a seperate branch for our DSI-5 repo because we want to avoid merge errors.\n",

    "### How branching works\n",

    "Branching allows you to create a separate timeline of the repo starting from the last commit.

And have another branch that has the experimental code, additions and deletions, without negatively affecting the production code. \n",

    "\n",
    "In industry, teams (or individuals) will create a branch from the master branch. They will introduce a new feature for the website or fit a bug in the code. They will then make a pull request to the administrator of the master branch. If the change is accepted, then it is merged with the master branch. The merge will either introduce new code, delete existing code, or overwrite existing code. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we want each student to create their own branch. So they can have a master version of their course material that the instructors share with them, and their personal branch where they can store all the changes that they have made to their jupyter notebooks without making changes to the master versions. For this class, *we will not be merging* student branches with the master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent Practice - (15 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "This independent practice has two exercises: **creating a new branch** and **making a pull request**. In order to make a pull request, we first need to create a branch (as explained in the How Branching Works section).\n",
