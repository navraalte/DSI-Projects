    "##### Helpful Notes to Keep in mind:\n",
    "1. P value for a coefficient says nothing about the size of the effect that variable is having on your dependent variable - it is possible to have a highly significant result (very small P-value) for a miniscule effect.\n",
    "2. With a P value of 5% (or .05) there is only a 5% chance that results you are seeing would have come up in a \n",
    "random distribution, so you can say with a 95% probability of being correct that the variable is having some effect, assuming your model is specified correctly.\n",
    "3. In simple or multiple linear regression, the size of the coefficient for each independent variable gives you \n",
    "the size of the effect that variable is having on your dependent/target (y) variable, and the sign on the coefficient \n",
    "(positive or negative) gives you the direction of the effect. In regression with a single independent/predictor variable, the coefficient tells you how much the dependent variable is expected to increase (if the coefficient is positive) or decrease (if the coefficient is negative) when that independent variable increases by one unit. \n",
    "4. In regression with multiple independent/predictors variables, the coefficient tells you how much the dependent variable is expected to increase when that independent variable increases by one unit, \"_holding all the other independent variables constant_\". Remember to keep in mind the units which your variables are measured in."
