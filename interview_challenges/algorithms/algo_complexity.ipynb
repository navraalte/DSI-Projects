    "\n",
    "### What is an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of instructions to find the solution to a problem.  It gives step-by-step operations to be performed that will take you from *any* valid input for the problem to an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been creating algorithms, in one form or another, throughout this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is efficiency?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we create algorithms, we need to be aware that they run on computers, and computers require time and space (memory) to process every instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though most of the algorithms we've written seem to run instantaneously, \"instant\" algorithms can possibly take minutes or days to run if there's too much input data to process.  For scalability and large systems, it's important to take into account the time and space an algorithm will need to run with larger sizes of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developers need ways to predict how _efficient_ an algorithm is when we give it different sizes of inputs.** This is measured in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time or \"runtime\" (how much processing time does it use in the CPU)\n",
    "- Space (how much memory does it take up)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried to get a 100% accurate picture of how long an algorithm would take, the analysis required would be so hard it wouldn't be useful for predictions.  We'd basically have to use the algorithm, or run the function, and record how long it took.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of getting exact values, developers often estimate the efficiency of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to express these estimates is using what is called Big O Notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big O Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation gives us a simplified way to talk about the  time and space requirements of an algorithm (often called time and space \"complexity\").  To identify an algorithm's complexity, we focus on the \"family\" of scaling functions the algorithm belongs to. We don't care about exact values.\n",

    "Big O notation gives an upper limit for how long or how much space an algorithm could take. We try to get estimates that are close to what time or space will actually be required, but Big O is a guarantee that that the resources it takes to complete the algorithm, as inputs grow infinitely large, will be less than or equal to some constant multiple complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Those constant multiples can get *really* large, meaning sometimes an O(n) algorithm will run faster than an O(log (n)) algorithm.\n",

    "### Rules for Evaluating Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you predict the complexity of a given algorithm? We can look for certain\n",
    "features to help us characterize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Think of a name (often `n`) for the size of the input. If you have multiple inputs, like `arr1`, `arr2`, assign different names for each one (size of `arr1` is `n`; size of `arr2` is `m`).\n",
    "-   For consecutive statements, add the complexities of each.  \n",
    "-   For branching statements (`if/else`), use the complexity of the worse\n",
    "    branch.\n",
    "-   For loops, multiply the maximum number of times the loop can run by the complexity of the work inside the loop.\n",
    "-   Simplify: eliminate constant multiples within parentheses (`O(2n)` -> `O(n)`), constant multiples of a single big-o family (`8*O(n)` -> `O(n)`), and entire smaller terms (`O(n) + 3*O(1)` -> `O(n)`).  Don't remove smaller terms that use a different name for the input size: `O(n) + O(log(m))` doesn't simplify.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "To say an algorithm takes constant (or `O(1)`) time means: no matter how big the input(s) are, the computer will do basically same amount of work to perform the algorithm on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant time steps are the building blocks of algorithms - they correspond to the most basic steps a computer can take.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll consider most mathematical operations to be `O(1)`: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<`, `>`. `==`, `===`.  (This assumes that the numbers are all with some limited size like 32-bit numbers or 64-bit numbers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment (`=`), `return`, and accessing a value in an array (`arr[4]`) or object (`obj['a']`) are other examples of steps that are considered `O(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function isFirstUndefined(numArray){\n",
    "  var first = numArray[0];\n",
    "  return first === undefined;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function average(a,b){\n",
    "    return (a-b)/2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the algorithms above each perform more than one `O(1)` step. The key factor that makes the algorithms `O(1)` is that the amount of calculations doesn't depend on the size of the inputs `numArray`, `a`, or `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Optional: Turn to a partner and convince each that the amount of calculations above doesn't depend on the size of the inputs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "To say an algorithm is linear or `O(n)` means the resources required grow proportionally to the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that process each input at least once will take at least **O(n)** time.  Loops are a common example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function addAll(numArray){\n",
    "    var sum = 1;                             // O(1)\n",
    "    for (var i=0; i<numArray.length; i++){   // n times:\n",
    "        sum = sum + numArray[i];                // O(1)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return sum;                              // O(1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following our [rules for evaluating complexity](#evaluating-complexity), the time complexity of `addAll` is `O(1) + n*O(1) + O(1)`. You might be tempted to call this `O(n) + 2*O(1)`, but don't forget to  simplify!  \n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>*Optional: What would happen if the work going on inside the loop had been O(n<sup>2</sup>)?* </summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "We still follow the exact same rules, so instead of the term from the loop being `n*O(1)`, we get `n` * O(n<sup>2</sup>), which yields O(n<sup>3</sup>).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### O(log(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "Any algorithm which cuts the problem size in half each at each step is logarithmic or `O(log n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms take longer for larger inputs, but the rate of increase is very slow compared to a lot of other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>*Optional: Can you think of an example of an `O(log n)` algorithm?*</summary>\n",

    "  return false if high < low\n",
    "  # Determine the middle element.\n",
    "  mid = low + ((high - low) / 2)\n",
    "  # Split the result in half and search again recursively until we succeed.\n",

    "#### O(n log(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll usually see `O(n log(n))` in \"divide and conquer\" algorithms that cut a problem into halves, *solve both halves*, and combine the results into a final solution.  This `O(n log(n))` complexity is famous for being the fastest possible time complexity of sorting algorithms on unrestricted inputs.\n",
