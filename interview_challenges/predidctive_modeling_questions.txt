### Predictive Modeling Interview Questions ###

# Technical Questions

1. What could be some issues if distribution of test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data? 

2. What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers? 

3. What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate?

4. What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced? What if there are more than 2 groups?

5. What are various ways to predict a binary response vari-
able? Can you compare two of them and tell me when one would be more appropriate? What’s the difference between these? (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, etc.)

6. What is regularization and where might it be helpful? What is an example of using regularization in a model?

7. Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?

# Problem Framing Questions 

8. Given training data on tweets and their retweets, how would you predict the number of retweets of a given tweet after 7 days after only observing 2 days worth of data?

9. How would you construct a feed to show relevant content for a site that involves user interactions with items?

10. How would you design the people you may know feature on LinkedIn or Facebook?

11. How would you predict who someone may want to send a Snapchat or Gmail to?

12. How would you suggest to a franchise where to open a new store?

13. In a search engine, given partial data on what the user hastyped, how would you predict the user’s eventual search query?
