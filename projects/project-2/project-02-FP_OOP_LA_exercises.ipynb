    "* Use the get_distance() method to print the distances between several of the rockets in your fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. PART 2 : Applying Inheritance\n",
    "* Define a class SpaceShuttle() which extends class Rocket()\n",
    "* Add more attributes that are particular to space shuttles such as maximum number of flights, capability of supporting spacewalks, and capability of docking with the ISS.\n",
    "* Add a method to the class, that relates to shuttle behavior. This method could simply print a statement, such as \"Docking with the ISS,\" for a dock_ISS() method.\n",
