<b>Methodology</b>

Every company has different standards for publishing the information.  We normalized the data to make it comparable. Here we describe the normalization methods we used. 

- Twitter uses the value "< 10" for countries that submitted less than ten requests. All other service providers published the exact number. To carry out calculations and comparisons with the Twitter data, we converted " < 10"  to the medium value of 5.5.
- Apart from the data included here, Dropbox has received 90 requests from countries other than the U.S. For legal reasons, Dropbox has not yet published the names of the countries that have filed these requests. These requests were not included in the Transparency Report. 
- Most service providers publish reports covering six months of requests. In some cases service providers published a yearly report. In these cases, the data on the requests has been divided by two. Each half was assigned to six months of the year to properly align with the other Transparency Reports. We used this normalization process in the following cases:
 - AT&T (2013)
 - Cloudfare (2013)
 - CREDO (2013)
 - Dropbox (2012 and 2013)
 - Sonic.net (2011 and 2012)
 - Microsoft (2012)
 - Tumblr (2013)
 - Verizon (2013)

- Verizon doesn't publish information on the number of requests it complies with. For that reason we could not add Verizon compliance rate data to the Silk Transparency Report Database. AT&T publishes information on the number of requests it complies with but it publishes the data in a relatively complicated manner. The AT&T reports combine requests that don't produce data with requests that lead to the disclosure of "partial data". This is ambiguous and differs from the clearer distinctions offered in the reports of all other companies, where the disclosure of "partial data" is separated from "no data disclosure". For this reason information on AT&T's compliance rate is left empty.

- A note on the United States, NSL and FISA. The data in the Silk Transparency Reports database contains only requests that the United States Federal Government has submitted through defined legal processes (Court Orders, Subpoenas, Search Warrants, etc.). In January 2014, the US Department of Justice announced that it is now permissible for companies to release information on the number of National Security Letters and FISA court orders to disclose data. These disclosures will be permitted only in broad ranges. While these ranges may provide some insights, in practice it is impossible to carry out any proper data analysis using such broad measures. For this reason,  we chose to exclude this type of data from this database. Additionally, not every company has yet updated their Transparency Reports with this information.

- Additionally, Transparency Reports on government information requests are not complete even in terms of governmental access to user's data. The reports contain the requests that law enforcement authorities file through standard legal procedures - thus excluding data collected through bulk surveillance programs and unauthorized interceptions, like NSA's PRISM or GCHQ's Tempora.
